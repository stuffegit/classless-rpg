# Trying to make smth from scratch, rpg game with some randomization sounds fun

no clue how to render anything, its gonna be terminal only for now

char creation works
combat partially works
resting works(i hope)
lvlup works

todo: 
more interesting bonuses that dont just increase die size
gear?(scary)
spells other than heal
town feature? not sure what to do there. quests? shops? better resting?

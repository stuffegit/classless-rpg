# Trying to make smth from scratch, rpg game with some randomization sounds fun

no clue how to render anything, its gonna be terminal only for now

char creation works<br>
combat partially works<br>
resting works(i hope)<br>
lvlup works<br>

todo: <br>
more interesting bonuses that dont just increase die size<br>
gear?(scary)<br>
spells other than heal<br>
town feature? not sure what to do there. quests? shops? better resting?
